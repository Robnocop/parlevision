the common.pri files should set all the include stuff correctly if it doesn't please check the project files. 
the common.pri file is based on personal very PC dependend settings please to not include it in any git version. Instead i used a template file that can help to make your common file work if you made some wrong choices or things during install.

The save image processor saves file as last int +1
Viola Jones Processor- scale factor 
	has a great impact on performance: a high scale factor may lead to fast but inaccurate detectors; a small scale factor increases accuracy at the cost of speed (typical value: 1.25).

to add a plugin add a cpp and when neccesary a header file in a directory
add the file (if in existing directory) to the .pro file in that directory.

to apply changes to a processor it has to be rebuild and this can be done project wise so it will save a lot of time when compared to building an entire solution

!!!!
- g++ compiler does not work as it will not include the proper libraries somehow. 
- somehow when using build--> run qmake it does work as it will then use the msvs2010

or 
- add a directory in src and add this directory in the src/src.pri file
- add this directory in the parlevvision-all.pri file
- pragmatic solution copy paste helloworld file and change the names into your own header files and classes etc.
- only need to change the processor plugin deals with other kind of stuf
- add a line to include the pipelinelement ub the proccesor of the plugin
